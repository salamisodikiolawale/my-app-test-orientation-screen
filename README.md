# my-app-test-orientation-screen
To test do npm install.

Comments:
For this feature I based on the explanation of this article and adapted to my situation (https://adrianhall.github.io/react%20native/2017/07/26/handling-orientation-changes-in-react-native/).

There is not much to install, just use import the Dimensions of react-native and install ScreenOrientation (https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/screen-orientation/)
